title: Managing fire risk in the Amazon ahead of an El Nino year
authors: [ben, prakrut]

The Amazon Rainforest, commonly known as the "lungs of the Earth," is crucial for regulating the global climate and preserving biodiversity. However, it is under threat from deforestation and an increasing number of wildfires due to long-term climate change and short-term climate variability. One major factor that heightens the fire risk in the Amazon is the El Niño phenomenon, which typically worsens dry conditions. SERVIR, a partnership between NASA and USAID, provides specialized forecasts (ranging from subseasonal to seasonal) that are essential for predicting and mitigating these risks.

Global climate models have demonstrated the ability to accurately predict the development of El Niño. Their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts deliver vital information on weather and climate patterns over periods ranging from a few weeks to several months. In the Amazon, these forecasts provide a critical opportunity to prepare for the heightened fire risk linked to El Niño events. With advanced knowledge of when and where dry conditions are expected, authorities and organizations can implement proactive strategies to minimize the impact of wildfires.
